# Toolbox

This repository contains my take of a simple, convenient and visually pleasant set of tools that I find myself using on a daily basis, using a CL interface.

These projects were done using Bubble Tea of Charm CLI, a Go framework for building terminal applications.

## Todo
A simple todo app that enables the user to:

- Create and delete tasks lists;
- Create and delete tasks within lists;
  
Data is stored locally in a JSON file located in the following directory: ```root/.toolbox/.todo/storage.json``` where ```root ``` is the root directory.
